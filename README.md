#Bay Area Bike Share Analysis

In this project, you will put yourself in the shoes of a data analyst performing an exploratory analysis on the data. You will take a look at two of the major parts of the data analysis process: data wrangling and exploratory data analysis. But before you even start looking at data, think about some questions you might want to understand about the bike share data. Consider, for example, if you were working for Bay Area Bike Share: what kinds of information would you want to know about in order to make smarter business decisions? Or you might think about if you were a user of the bike share service. What factors might influence how you would want to use the service?
